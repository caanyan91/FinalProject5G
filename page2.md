The internet of things is a network of objects that are connected and embedded with sensors software and tehcnology for the purpose of connecting and sharing data with devices and systems over the internet. 5G has allowed for Smart homes to become available. Smart homes are typically a bunch of appliances controlled by one digital network. 
A user will typically control thermostats. appliances, television, and radio all from the control of their voice.
