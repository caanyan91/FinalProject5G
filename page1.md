## Definition and History of Mobile Networks
A mobile network is also known as a wireless network. This network routes communications in the form of radio waves to and from users. These operate by base stations which cover a certain area or cell. When cells are joined together this allows for radio coverage over a large area. This allows for communication within a network that is based on radio waves, not direct connections. 1G was the first wireless network. G stands for generation. Currently today 5G network isnt everywhere but starting to surface into society rapidly.  <br>
1G was launched by Nippon Telegraph and telephone in 1979. This was first introduced in Tokyo. Within 5 years (by 1984) 1G covered all of Japan. In 1983 1G was introduced to the United States.  <br>
2G was launched in 1991 in Finland. Some features and upgrades of 2G was improved sound quality, reducing static and background noise. Download speeds also seemed to increase with approximately 0.2 Mbps download speed (very slow compared to modern day).  <br>
3G Came out in 2001 which was publicly across Japan. Main focus of 3G was to focus on standardization of vendors network protocol. Some notice features were speeds improving to 2 Mbps from 0.2 Mbps.  <br>
4G was introduced in Norwar in 2009. 4G is todays standard service. Some improvements are 12.5 Mbps speeds. Also 4G allows for video streams and chats, fast acceptable mobile web access. 4G also allows for high definition videos as well as supports online gaming. Speeds since first introduced have also been improved. Today average median download speeds are in the 50 Mbps range.  <br>
5G was first offered in South Korea in 2019. 5G has much faster download speeds. In Canada the average spped is around 170 Mbps. A main difference in 4G vs 5G is the latency and bandwidth. 4G latency averages around  50 milliseconds. 5G averages around 10 milliseconds. 5G has a much larger frequency range . Approximately between 30 GHz and 300 Ghz.
